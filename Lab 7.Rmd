Getting gc_df.csv data, loading the tidyverse, and getting some summary counts
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
gc_df<- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

# filter function gets rid of NA's in the columns that we want
get_guns <- gc_df %>%
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA")%>%
  count(gender, make_get_guns)%>%
  spread(make_get_guns, n)%>%
  select(-gender) #takes out the male and female column
  
rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female", "Male")
  
```
